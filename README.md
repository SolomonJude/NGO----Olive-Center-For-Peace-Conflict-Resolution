# NGO----Olive-Center-For-Peace-Conflict-Resolution

This is a website for Olive Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution, a non-profit organization. This website was built using [HTML, CSS, JavaScript] and features[scrollreveal, & swiper-bundel].

I built this website alongside with bedimcode on youtube but went ahead in adding some more features. During development, I faced challenges in making the team section responsive but all thanks to google. I had it all fixed and i can say that my code is up and running.
